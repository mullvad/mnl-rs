# mnl-sys

Low level FFI bindings to [`libmnl`]. A minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink
developers. See [`mnl`] for a higher level safe abstraction.

These bindings were generated with bindgen. See the `generate_bindings.sh` script in the
repository.

## Linking to libmnl

By default this crate uses pkg-config to find and link to [`libmnl`]. To manually configure
where to look for the library, set the environment variable `LIBMNL_LIB_DIR` to point to the
directory where `libmnl.so` or `libmnl.a` resides.

## Selecting version of `libmnl`

This crate has bindings for multiple versions of [`libmnl`]. All bindings are generated by
[`bindgen`] via the `generate_bindings.sh` script in this repository.

Only one version of `libmnl` can be exposed via this crate. By default the crate exports the
bindings for the oldest supported version (`libmnl-1.0.3`). To get newer versions activate the
corresponding features. See `Cargo.toml` for available features/versions.

So for example, to get bindings to `libmnl-1.0.4` depend on this crate like this:
```toml
[dependencies]
mnl-sys = { version = "0.1", features = ["mnl-1-0-4"] }
```
